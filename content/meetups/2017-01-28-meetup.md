## Le sujet de la soirée

Note: Les descriptions sont en anglais mais les talks seront en français!

### Containers as common runtime for your test infrastructure

Lots of database are easy to test because you can embed them in the JVM. Other databases will have an in-memory implementation or mock solutions. Some however won't work this way. Or maybe you would prefer to test the actual Database deployment in your integration test.
One of the available solutions these days is to use containers. In this TIA I'll show you how to use TestContainers to test common SQL databases. Then I'll show you how to add support for the NoSQL database Couchbase.


### CONTAINERS, VMS, PROCESSES… ISOLATION, PERFORMANCES, I/O… COMMENT CES TECHNOLOGIES FONCTIONNENT ET COMMENT LES DIFFÉRENCIER?

Everybody is now using virtualization, containers are all the rage today, and microkernels start to gain traction… But how is all this working? How did these solutions come to be? What are the differences between containers and virtual machines? Where and why should you use docker, runc, rocket, kvm, xen, virtualbox, includeOS, rancherOS? This talk is a full session providing understanding on how these technologies work, how they compare to each other, and lot’s of demo to understand differences and fundamental concept on isolation. So, let’s look under the hood, and understand how your system works (hint: it’s not magic). And yes, it will be understandable even if you are not an OPS or an expert. That’s precisely the point.
