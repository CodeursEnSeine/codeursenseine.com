I am a Principal Software Engineer living in Paris. I evolved in the Java EE
landscape for a while and then moved on to Spring, Micronaut and Quarkus. From
distributed systems to microservices and functions, today I work in the Cloud on
Java on Azure.

Aside from developing, I wrote a few books (Java EE and Quarkus), talk at
international conferences (Devoxx, JavaOne, GeeConâ€¦), write technical papers and
articles, give on-line courses (PluralSight, Udemy) and co-present the Technical
French pod cast Les Cast Codeurs. I have co-created the Paris JUG, Voxxed
Microservices and Devoxx France. For all this work for the community I have been
made Java Champion a few years ago.
