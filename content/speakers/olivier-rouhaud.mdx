My name is Olivier Rouhaud, I currently work as a freelance Agile Coach & Engineering Manager. During my almost 15 years of professional experience Iâ€™ve been a developer, team leader, project manager, scrum master, trainer, manager and agile coach (more or less in that order and sometimes several at the same time :) What I like most is to help people in their daily job, find better ways to work together and adapt to the constant evolution and needs of companies. So methodology and management/leadership are my main domains of interest.
